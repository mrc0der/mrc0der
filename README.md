I am a 15-year veteran in multiple areas including virtualization, cloud architectures, security, and technology consulting. Outside of work, I love to spend time in my workshop building anything with my son, photography and videography are huge passions, participate in security competitions, and spends time with the wife and kiddos. I maintain many technical blogs aimed at sharing technology and innovation with all.
